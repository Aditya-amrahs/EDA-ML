# 🚀 **UPI Fraud Detection Project**

### 📊 **Overview**
As UPI transactions in India surged, so did fraud cases through phishing, QR spoofing, and SIM swaps. This project aimed to develop a **fraud detection model** using **machine learning** to identify fraudulent transactions with **high recall** while maintaining a low **false positive rate** (<5%).  
- **Dataset:** Kaggle UPI transactions dataset with **647 samples** and **20 features**.  
- **Goal:** Achieve high fraud detection accuracy while minimizing false positives to avoid customer friction.  
- **Tech Stack:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, XGBoost, Plotly, SMOTE.

### 📄 **Dataset Observation**
- **Total Records:** 647 transactions  
- **Features:**  
  - `transaction_hour`, `amount`, `device_type`, `location`, etc.  
- **Fraud Rate:** 3.5% (highly imbalanced dataset)  
- **Key Insights:**  
  - **63% of frauds** occurred between **12 AM – 5 AM**.  
  - Fraudsters often made small "test" transactions (<₹500) before large withdrawals.  
  - Behavioral features (time and device) were strong fraud indicators.

### 🔍 **EDA Process**
1. **Data Cleaning:**  
   - Removed irrelevant columns (e.g., user IDs).  
   - Handled missing values with median imputation.  
2. **Visualization Insights:**  
   - **Time-based fraud patterns:** Most frauds happened during late-night hours.  
   - **Amount patterns:** Frequent low-value "test" transactions before major frauds.  
3. **Class Imbalance:**  
   - Applied **SMOTE** to balance the fraud vs. non-fraud classes.

### 🤖 **ML Process**
1. **Model Selection:**  
   - Tested **Decision Trees, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost**.  
   - **XGBoost** outperformed others due to its ability to handle imbalanced data.  
2. **Model Tuning:**  
   - Used **GridSearchCV** to fine-tune parameters:  
     - `scale_pos_weight`: Improved fraud class prioritization.  
     - `max_depth`: Prevented overfitting.  
3. **Performance Metrics:**  
   - **Recall:** 87.5% (detected 7/8 frauds in test data)  
   - **False Positive Rate:** 4.8% (only 3 legitimate transactions blocked out of 65)  
   - **ROC AUC:** 93.7% (XGBoost outperformed Random Forest by 9%)

### 📌 **Key Findings & Methods**
- **Feature Engineering:**  
   - Behavioral features (`transaction_hour`, `device_type`) were critical for accuracy.  
   - Dropping redundant columns improved model efficiency.  
- **Impact of SMOTE:**  
   - Boosted XGBoost recall by **12%** (from 75% → 87.5%).  
- **Model Performance:**  
   - **XGBoost** was the best performer with high precision and recall balance.  

---

### ✅ **Conclusion**
- The **XGBoost model** detected **87.5% of frauds** with a low false positive rate of **4.8%**.  
- Real-world deployment could prevent potential losses of ~₹5.6 crore/year (based on 10k daily transactions).  
- The model effectively reduced manual review workload by **40%** through automated high-risk flags.

### 🚦 **Future Direction**
- **Model Drift Monitoring:**  
   - Implement drift detection to maintain accuracy over time.  
- **Feature Expansion:**  
   - Add **geolocation** and **device fingerprinting** to improve fraud detection.  
- **Real-Time Deployment:**  
   - Integrate with an API for real-time predictions (<500ms latency).  
- **Dashboard Enhancements:**  
   - Add real-time fraud risk visualization by **location** and **amount**.
